# Full code review

Perform a comprehensive review of all changes in the current branch against main.

## Step 0 — Load project context

**Before reviewing anything, read `CLAUDE.md` to understand this project's actual architecture and conventions.**

The architecture check in Step 2 must be based on what CLAUDE.md describes — not on an assumed ideal. If the project uses simple 3-layer architecture, evaluate against that. If it uses Clean Architecture, evaluate against that. Never report a deviation against an architecture the project does not claim to follow.

Then run:
- `git diff main...HEAD` — full diff
- `git diff main...HEAD --stat` — list of changed files
- `git log main...HEAD --oneline` — commit history

---

## Step 1 — Review dimensions

Evaluate every changed file across all dimensions below. Not every dimension applies to every file — use judgment.

### Business logic
- Does the change correctly implement the intended behavior?
- Is business logic in the correct layer according to the architecture described in CLAUDE.md?
- Are edge cases handled (empty collections, nulls, boundary values)?
- Does the change affect existing behavior unintentionally?

### Architecture and SOLID
- Do dependencies respect the layer direction described in CLAUDE.md?
- Does each class have a single responsibility?
- Are new types/behaviors added via extension rather than modifying existing classes (OCP)?
- Are abstractions used correctly — no leaking lower-layer concerns upward?
- Are interfaces used for dependencies — no `new` for services?

### Design patterns
- Are there `if/else` or `switch` blocks that should be replaced with Strategy, Factory or polymorphism?
- Are complex business rules expressed as Specification instead of nested conditionals?
- Are there long parameter lists that should be parameter objects?
- Is there duplicated logic that should be extracted?

### Performance
- Are read queries using `.AsNoTracking()`?
- Are projections used (`.Select()`) instead of loading full entities to read a few fields?
- Are collection endpoints paginated?
- Is there risk of N+1 queries?
- Are bulk operations using `ExecuteUpdateAsync` / `ExecuteDeleteAsync` instead of loading entities?
- Is `.ToList()` called eagerly where it shouldn't be?

### Memory leaks and resource management
- Is `new HttpClient()` used anywhere? (socket exhaustion) → must use `IHttpClientFactory`
- Are `IDisposable` / `IAsyncDisposable` objects wrapped in `using`?
- Is `async void` used outside of event handlers?
- Are event subscriptions cleaned up in `Dispose`?
- Is `DbContext` being held open longer than a single operation scope?
- Are closures capturing `this` or large objects in long-lived callbacks?

### Concurrency and DI lifetime
- Is a `Scoped` service being injected into a `Singleton`? (captive dependency)
- Is `DbContext` injected directly into a `Singleton`?
- Is shared mutable state accessed from multiple threads without synchronization?
- Is `.Result` or `.Wait()` called on async code (deadlock risk)?

### Security
- Are there hardcoded secrets, credentials, tokens or internal URLs?
- Are new endpoints protected with appropriate authorization policies?
- Is user input validated at the API boundary before being processed?
- Are internal database IDs exposed in the API response?
- Is sensitive data being logged (passwords, tokens, PII)?

### Naming and conventions
- Do conventions match what is described in CLAUDE.md (not a universal standard)?
- Do all async methods have the `Async` suffix?
- Are DTOs named as described in CLAUDE.md (`XRequest`/`XResponse` or whatever the project uses)?
- Are constants used instead of hardcoded strings (except log messages)?
- Is the code in English?

### Null safety
- Are there `null` returns from services instead of `Result<T>` or exceptions?
- Are nullable warnings suppressed with `!` without justification?
- Do collection-returning methods return empty collections instead of `null`?

### Tests
- Is there new business logic without corresponding unit tests?
- Do tests follow AAA with explicit `// Arrange`, `// Act`, `// Assert` sections?
- Are all critical paths covered: happy path, expected errors, edge cases?
- Are mocks used for external dependencies?

### Configuration and environment
- Were new environment variables or `appsettings` keys added?
  - Are they documented in `README.md`?
  - Are they in `.env.example` if the project uses Docker?
  - Are they validated at startup with `ValidateOnStart()`?
- Was the Options pattern used — not raw `IConfiguration` in services?

### Docker (if docker-compose was modified)
- Does every service have a `healthcheck` defined?
- Does every service have a `restart` policy?
- Do services use `depends_on` with `condition: service_healthy` for their dependencies?
- Are secrets coming from `.env` and not hardcoded in the compose file?

### Documentation
- If the change affects architecture or a significant design decision — was an ADR created in `/docs/adr/`?
- If the change adds/modifies configuration, endpoints or deployment — was `README.md` updated?
- If new technical debt is introduced — was `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` updated?
